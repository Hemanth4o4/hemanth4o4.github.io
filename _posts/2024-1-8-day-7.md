title: (Day 7) Applying the time series knowledge to practice
categories: [time-series, applying-knowledge]

## Hello :) Today is Day 7!
A quick summary of today:
* [WON/USD exchange rate prediction model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/divakaivan12/basic-linear-regression-to-predict-kr-won-to-usd)
* [Seoul Bike Rental Demand - Linear Regression Model and Seasonal Features](https://www.kaggle.com/code/divakaivan12/beginner-linear-regression-seasonality-features)

Following yesterday's Kaggle time series course, I decided to apply what I learned.
The links go to the Kaggle notebooks for each model. Below I will try to provide an overview of both.

### WON/USD exchange rate prediction model

**Data**

I used simple interpolation to deal with missing data points

**Feature engineering**
lag_1 - made 1 day behind lag feature

**Model evaluation**
R-squared: 0.9941
Mean Squared Error: 63.3640
Mean Absolute Error: 4.6090

Homoscedasticity check

The model results seem good, but I know that the used features are not that good because I only use lag_1 (I just applied what I learned yesterday)

### Seoul Bike Rental Demand
Looked to do time series forecast using Seoul Bicycle Demand Data, which includes daily and hourly information and weather information on bicycles rented in Seoul. The goal was to construct a basic linear regression model that integrates seasonal features and holiday information.

**Some data viz**

**Checked for a trend (seems like there is not)**

**Seasonality check**

Seems there is annual, and no daily.

After adding seasonality features, the model results:

Also made a 2nd model, that includes holiday data:

**Results**

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
