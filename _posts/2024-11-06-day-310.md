# Hello :) Today is Day 310!
A quick summary of today:
* did the scikit-learn exam
* streamed for ~30mins

I was originally scheduled to do the exam at around 1pm. Long story short, I started it at 5.45.

Before the exam I was just re-doing the questions in the sklearn MOOC. Then I could not start when I wanted because I faced several issues with webassessor but thankfully the issues were not on my side so the exam kept getting reschedule without incurring extra fees.

I am waiting for the certificate, so here is just a confirmation from the website ^^

I think I know what I got wrong ðŸ˜† anyway ~ ...

After the exam, I rested for a bit and wanted to do a short stream to talk about the exam and also [skore](https://github.com/probabl-ai/skore) - a new open-source project by probable.

[Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=HHWiU7GoGCo&t=1387s) is a link to the stream. 

Also ~ I was told by someone from the probabl team that I am the 1st to complete the exam ðŸ¥³
