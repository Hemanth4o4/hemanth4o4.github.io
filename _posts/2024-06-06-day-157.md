## Hello :) Today is Day 157!
A quick summary of today:
* read about design choices for GNNs
* started reading a book about MLOps on manning.com
* registered for Korea summer workshop on causal inference

### Design choices for Graph Neural Networks [[arxiv](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2011.08843)]

I saw this paper from the last short lecture from XCS224W: ML with graphs, it looks into how different design choices affect a GNN model's performance. It caugt my eye as some of the findings as to what is useful could be tested/applied in my work/research at the lab. 

Below are some of the interesting findings:

For example, having batch norm is always better more than not having it; no dropout seems to perform better too, prelu activation seems the best, and using sum as an aggregation function outperforms mean and max. 

### Design a Machine Learning System (From Scratch) [[book](https://www.manning.com/books/design-a-machine-learning-system-design-from-scratch)]

The book will teach me how to:

* Build an ML Platform
* Build and Deploy ML Pipelines
* Extend the ML Platform using various tools depending on use cases
* Implement different kinds of ML services using the ML life cycle as a mental model
* Deploy ML services that are reliable and scalable

A quick summary of chapter 1: Getting Started with MLOps and ML Engineering

An ML project begins with the experimental phase. This phase involves continuous iterations and adjustments across various steps, such as model training and evaluation, to refine models based on complex data and performance metrics. Building an orchestrated pipeline automates these steps, reducing errors and streamlining the process before full automation in later stages.

Next, is the Dev/Staging/Production phase marks the shift from model experimentation to deployment in real-world settings, emphasizing scalability, robustness, and real-time performance. This phase involves full automation of the pipeline, with continuous integration and performance monitoring to ensure smooth deployment and maintenance of ML models.

The skills needed for MLOps include software engineering, data science, DevOps, data management, model training, deployment, monitoring, debugging, and automation to ensure reproducibility and compliance.
An ML platform enables practitioners to develop and deploy ML services by integrating various tools essential for the ML life cycle. Typically, it comprises a collection of loosely related software that evolves as team maturity and use case complexity increase. This book guides you through building an ML platform using Kubeflow, covering components like pipeline orchestration, feature stores, and model registries.

### A Short Summary of Chapter 2: What is MLOps?

First step - Data Collection

- Data relevance to problem domain
- Size of the dataset with respect to problem complexity
- Quality of the dataset. Prevention of harmful biases and unintentional leakage of samples
- Distribution of data and features is representative of the deployment environment
- Sufficient diversity in the data collection process that defines the problem domain well
- Lineage and detailed tracking of raw data, intermediate versions, and annotated datasets

Second step - EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis)

- What does my data look like? What is its schema? Can the schema change? How would I guard against invalid values? Does the data require cleaning?
- How is my data distributed? Are all targets equally represented, or should there be additional class balancing?
- Does my data have robust features for the task I have in mind? Are the features expensive to compute?
- Does the input data vary cyclically? Does it exhibit correlations to external factors that are not modeled?
- Are there any outliers in the dataset? What must be done to outlier values in production?

Third step - Modelling and Training

- Model and data versioning
- Experiment tracking
- Model training pipelines
- Hyperparameter search

Fourth step - Model Evaluation

- Choosing the appropriate metrics
- Examine and analyse misclassified samples, error patterns

Fifth step - Deployment

- To a specific environment, or API endpoint
- Staging vs production

Sixth step - Monitoring

- Track anomalies in data and model performance
- Data/performance/error monitoring
- Need reliable notification/alert system

Seventh step - Maintenance, Updates, and Review

- Implement bug fixes to address issues and shortcomings in the model in production
- Collect data to train the model on specific edge cases and improve performance
- Mitigate data drift by informing the data collection component and retrain a new model

Importance of Robust MLOps

It is crucial because it ensures the seamless integration and collaboration of various specialized disciplines, leading to consistent and reliable model performance that drives business value. It addresses complex challenges such as data management, scalability, and compliance, reducing technical debt and enhancing the maintainability and scalability of ML projects. A robust framework supports continuous improvement and mitigates risks associated with data privacy, biases, and system failures.
