## Hello :) Today is Day 146!
A quick summary of today:
* did 2nd homework from MLOps zoomcamp on experiment tracking
* covered some material on devops on Azure

### MLOps zoomcamp Module 2 homework on experiment tracking

The homework link is [here](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/blob/main/cohorts/2024/02-experiment-tracking/homework.md). The homework followed the below outline:

1. Install mlflow
2. Preprocess NYC taxi data
3. Train a model with autolog
4. Launch a tracking server locally
5. Tune model hyperparams
6. Promote the best model

My code for it is on my [github](https://github.com/divakaivan/MLOps-camp).

The used model was a random forest regressor using rmse as the main evaluation metric. The homework was more focused on running mlflow commands rather than the preprocessing/training (which were done in Module 1 of the course). 

Below is a graphical comparison of some of the models I ran

I had to set up logging and mlflow db for a sample run

Run hyperparam optimization

And finally choosing and registering the best model

For a bit I faced an issue with the params passed to the model because they were missing (initially not logged in the hyperparam opt code), and then I kept registering the *worst* performing model because i had [0] at the end of that best run, but when I put [-1] it was all good. Below are the top 5 and then best among the 5 models is registerered.

As for the next module - [module 3](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main/03-orchestration), I saw we will use Mage to learn Orchestration and ML Pipelines and saw that the youtube videos were uploaded today. 

### 2nd prep course for Microsoft x NVIDIA hackaton in Microsoft's office in Seoul

It was a bit long so I covered just the bits I thought were new, and below are some notes I took along the way.

Azure Boards: tools for agile planning, work item tracking, visualization, and reporting

Azure Pipelines: a CI/CD platform that is language, platform, and cloud-agnostic, supporting containers and Kubernetes

Azure Repos: cloud-hosted private Git repositories with two types of version control: distributed (Git) and centralized (Team Foundation Version Control, TFVC). Features include

* Free private Git repositories
* Support for any Git client
* Web hooks and API integration
* Semantic code search
* Git code reviews with threaded discussion
* Continuous integration for each change
* Branch policies to ensure code quality
* Integration with favorite tools and editors

Azure Artifacts: Integrated package management supporting Maven, npm, Python, and NuGet packages from public or private sources

Azure Test Plans: An integrated solution for planned and exploratory testing

Workflows: Define automation processes, detailing trigger events and jobs to run. Workflows are written in YAML and located within the GitHub repository at .github/workflows. Example:

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/fa0ab85d-dbc8-41b2-84f2-832f9d5cbd29)

GitHub runners: compute resources that execute GitHub Actions workflows, performing build, test, and deployment tasks directly within GitHub repositories

Continuous integration with actions example

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/8dd18562-3a0d-4b30-89dd-32e23fcf9e6b)

* On: Specifies what will occur when code is pushed
* Jobs: There's a single job called build
* Strategy: It's being used to specify the Node.js version
* Steps: Are doing a checkout of the code and setting up dotnet
* Run: Is building the code

Next, Azure Pipelines is a robust service for creating cross-platform CI/CD workflows, integrating with your preferred Git provider and deploying to major cloud services. Key features

* End-to-end flow of value: Focus on delivering continuous value from concept to customer, avoiding siloed processes
* Automation and reliability: Establish a repeatable, reliable process for software delivery
* Quality verification: Each pipeline stage verifies feature quality to prevent user-facing errors
* Team feedback and visibility: Ensure all team members have feedback and visibility into the delivery process
* Frequent small changes: Promote frequent, smaller changes for better flow and optimization
* Continuous improvement: Continuously monitor and resolve obstacles to improve pipeline efficiency

Pipeline stages:

* Build automation and Continuous Integration: Automatic building and integrating of changes
* Test automation: Automated testing for functionality and quality
* Deployment automation: Automated deployment to various environments

Orchestration:

* Release and pipeline orchestration: Manage and control the entire pipeline, providing top-level insights
* Value stream mapping: Identify and improve inefficiencies
* Infrastructure efficiency: Efficient infrastructure is crucial for an effective pipeline

Key terms in Azure pipelines

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/192d19d3-2c62-437e-bd8e-04f324a46760)

* Agent: software that runs a build or deployment job
* Artifact: collection of files or packages published by a build, used for distribution or deployment
* Build: one execution of a pipeline, collecting logs and test results
* Continuous Delivery (CD): process of building, testing, and deploying code to various stages, ensuring quality through multiple stages and constant monitoring
* Continuous Integration (CI): practice of automating the testing and building of code to catch issues early. CI systems produce artifacts used in CD pipelines for automatic deployments
* Deployment target: destination for application deployment, such as a virtual machine, container, or web app
* Job: a set of steps run on an agent within a build, representing an execution boundary
* Pipeline: script defining the CI/CD process, composed of tasks for testing, building, and deploying
* Release: execution of a release pipeline, including deployments to multiple stage
* Stage: primary divisions in a pipeline, such as 'build,' 'test', and 'deploy'
* Task: building block of a pipeline, performing specific jobs like building, testing, or deploying
* Trigger: configuration that specifies when the pipeline should run, such as on code push or schedule

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
