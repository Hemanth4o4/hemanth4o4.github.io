title: (Day 141) Lognormal random variables and looking for a TA position
categories: [theory,math]
---

## Hello :) Today is Day 141!
A quick summary of today:
* read a bit more of A Primer For The Mathematics Of Financial Engineering by Dan Stefanica
* applied (sent an email) about becoming a TA for one of the undergraduate big data/ML/statistics courses in my uni

I like the Primer book because it is pure math - just Lemmas and Theorems and proving them (+ application in finance).

Below are my notes from Ch 4 - lognormal random variables

I saw that a deadline for the 4th assignment from Stanford's [XCS224W](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs224w-machine-learning-graphs): ML with Graphs is due on the 28th so I will likely start doing it in the afternoon after a quiz I have at uni. 

Also I saw that the official 2nd homework on model management and experiment tracking from the [MLOps zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp) is up, but let's see if I can do it tomorrow.



As for the 'application' to be a TA. I believe teaching is the highest form of knowing something. Being able to explain a concept to someone who does not know it and them understanding it is one of the biggest certifiers that someone really know's something. So I wrote an email in Korean about that I know python, some math, some statistics, have been studying and blogging here about ML/DL, so let's see if I can atleast meet with a professor even just for a chat.



That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
