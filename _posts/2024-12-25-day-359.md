# Hello :) Today is Day 359!
A quick summary of today:
* applying analytical patterns day 2
* streamed - looking back at books/courses I read/did over the past year for this blog
* covered a 1hr course on MLOps on databricks by Maria Vechtomova

## Applying analytical patterns [day 2](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7O7DH0ux0x4) (from Zach Wilson's bootcamp)

## [Streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kkp5kad64io&t=461s)

I went over 358 days worth of posts and collected a list of books and courses 

I will update it with the books/courses I read/do until the end of day 366 and maybe add books I will definitely read after the blog ends. I plan to post each part on linkedin on 2nd of Jan, or maybe do like a top 5/10 of books/courses.

## [MLOps course on LinkedIn learning by Maria Vechtomova](https://www.linkedin.com/learning/mlops-with-databricks/reduce-time-to-production-with-mlops)

I saw that Maria Vechtomova posted a 'free' course on MLOps on linkedin learning so I signed up for a 30-day free trial on the website and decided to check it out ~

Learning objectives:

* explain main components and principles required to deploy machine learning models to production on Databricks
* identify how to use experiment tracking system, model registry, feature engineering, model/feature serving, and other features required to deploy ML applications
* articulate how to package your Python code using best practices and deploy your project using Databricks Asset Bundles.
* review how to monitor your ML applications

### 1. MLOps components and principles

Interesting trend:

<img width="765" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/0a7c80f9-589a-4bbf-a1b5-6626c171db8d" />

DS became popular and soon after MLOps. Not surprising, I guess. Companies wanted to build models and then soon after they realised they need a more consistent way of developing, delivering, and maintaining them. 

The minimal set of tools for MLOps:

* version control
* CI/CD
* orchestration
* model registry
* container registry
* compute
* serving
* monitoring
* data version control
* other (feature store, labeling tool, exp. tracking, responsible AI, vector db, llm evaluation, llm frameworks, model hub)

There are many different options for each of the above

* reuse the tools available in your organization
* only add tools if needed
* the more tools you have, the more complex migrations you'll have to go through

**Principles**

Real business impact is involved if ML model predictions are unavailable or of bad quality. The goal of MLOps is to minimise the risk of things going wrong

Four main principles:

* documentation (business goals and KPIs, data definition, ML system architecture, the choice of ML models)
* code quality (review processes, code quality checks, unit and integration tests)
* traceability and reproducability (for a model this is the ease of finding: corresponding code and commits on git, the infrastructure used for training and serving, ML model artifacts, what data wasa used to train the model; reproducability: the same model with the same data and code can be generated, rollback is easy)
* monitoring and alerting (infrastructure health and costs, application health, response time and response codes, model eval and business metrics, data and model drift)

The first two are related to people and processes, while the last two are related to tools. 

**Databricks for MLOps**

It offers:

* orchestration
* model registry
* compute
* serving
* vector search
* exp. tracking
* prompt engineering
* feature engineering
* monitoring

### 2. MLflow

Offered a managed version by databricks

I could not follow the code exactly as I do not have a proper databricks subscription. I will create one for her course at the end of Jan.

But that did not stop me from running the code locally with a local mlflow server 😆.

<img width="1511" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c6570ce8-5c95-414c-a643-e42998d72833" />

(I cloned the repo and started running files locally). But I faced some issues with pyspark as the env was done all with uv and I kept getting `RuntimeError: Only remote Spark sessions using Databricks Connect are supported. Use DatabricksSession.builder to create a remote Spark session instead.` I guess I could try to do the whole thing locally ~ I just continued watching at this point. She even says that some parts don't work well in vs code so it's better to run them in databricks ~ 😆 So as most of the time ~ I will focus on the ideas rather than the exact implementation/code

The code for all of it is on [github](https://github.com/LinkedInLearning/mlops-with-databricks-2019584)

### 3. Feature engineering

Databricks feature engineering concepts

* `FeatureTable`: a table stored as a Delta table in Unity catalog that contains ML model features
* `FeatureFunction`: a class that specifies a Python UDF in Unity catalog
* `FeatureLookup`: a class that specifies how to look up features in the feature table
* `TrainingSet`: a class that defines how to construct a train set using a feature table, FeatureFunction, and FeatureLookup
* `FeatureSpec`: feature specification defined as a list containing instances of FeatureLookup and FeatureFunction

Feature engineering client functionality

* create, update, and delete feature tables and feature specifications
* create a training dataset
* log an MLflow model packaged with information on how a training set was built

### 4. Feature and Model serving

<img width="607" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/b55a366f-d04f-4c47-ac6a-7aedf1a8c974" />

<img width="634" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/7b6a9534-7beb-427a-9dc3-97c7f3ea7111" />

**When to use feature serving**

* predictions are precomputed and need to be accessed at the moment of request
* a simple function that does not require a model artifact must be computed at the moment of request

**When to use model serving**

* there is a model artifact
* optionally, some features must be retrieved at the moment of request

### 5. Deploy apps using Databricks Asset Bundles

Ways to deploy a databricks job:

* terraform
* databricks APIs
* databricks asset bundles (DABs) (recommended way as it manages dependencies and files required to be manually handles if using the first two options)

DAB is deployed by defining a pipeline in a yaml file where we essentially define a job, its schedule, tags, where to run it (compute), and its tasks + there are extra things we can specify ~

This is how it looks like on Maria's databricks:

<img width="1510" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/58088418-910d-42e3-9ae0-753586854002" />

### 6. Monitoring using Inference Tables and Lakehouse Monitoring

**What must be monitored**

* application and infrastructure health
* application performance and costs
* model and data drift
* business value
* for some use cases, fairness and bias

Monitoring can be done again in the `databricks.yml` file as a job.

**With Lakehouse monitoring we can**

* monitor data drift
* monitor model drift (if the GT is provided)

**Lakehouse Monitoring components**

* profile metrics table (Delta table with summary stats for each slicing window)
* drift metrics table (Delta table with with stats and different drift detection metrics)
* customisable dashboard

Overall ~ awesome 🔥

That is all for today!

Merry Christmas! 

See you tomorrow :)
