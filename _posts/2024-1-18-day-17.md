## Hello :) Today is Day 17!
A quick summary of today:
* Classification and Clustering from [Microsoft](https://github.com/microsoft/ML-For-Beginners)

I summarized the content in the photos below

We can deal with imbalanced data using the `imblearn` library (before vs after using SMOTE)

Lastly, I tried mading a website with a model of what food to eat today

After selecting ingredients, you will receive cooking recommendations based on your choice

When I was covering the clustering material, I found a good way to visualize the data in such cases

I could not start preparation for the TensorFlow developer certificate today, but I will definitely start tomorrow!

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
