## Hello :) Today is Day 11!
A quick summary of today:
* Binary Classification with a Bank Churn Dataset on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1)
* My [notebook](https://www.kaggle.com/code/divakaivan12/various-svm-models-for-bank-churn-classification) with various SVM models for bank churn classification

**Data**

I tried various SVM models and SVM-hybrind models, and below are the results from all

**Basic SVM model**
* Accuracy: 0.8554246069015663
* Precision: 0.7598201609086607
* Recall: 0.4608208955223881
* F1-Score: 0.5737001965338574
* AUC-ROC: 0.7109204519856266
* Confusion Matrix:
* [[25024  1015]
 [ 3757  3211]]

**SVM and RandomForestClassifier model**
* Accuracy: 0.7972854243039356
* Precision: 0.5216507738002188
* Recall: 0.4789035591274397
* F1-Score: 0.49936401047512163
* AUC-ROC: 0.6806937627427974
* Confusion Matrix:
* [[22979  3060]
 [ 3631  3337]]

**SVM and KNeighborsClassifier model**
* Accuracy: 0.8378828733298997
* Precision: 0.6524608712049783
* Recall: 0.4965556831228473
* F1-Score: 0.5639312199494744
* AUC-ROC: 0.7128886177049008
* Confusion Matrix:
* [[24196  1843]
 [ 3508  3460]]

**Hyperparam tuned SVM model** 
I did manual hyperparam tuning to see the effects of various changes, and this took me the most time, and in the end - it had the same result as the base model

* Accuracy: 0.8554246069015663
* Precision: 0.7598201609086607
* Recall: 0.4608208955223881
* F1-Score: 0.5737001965338574
* AUC-ROC: 0.7109204519856266
* Confusion Matrix:
* [[25024  1015]
 [ 3757  3211]]

Overall, the training time for each model was very long. I guess SVM is like that.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
