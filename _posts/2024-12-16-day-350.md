# Hello :) Today is Day 350!
A quick summary of today:
* covering week 4 - Streaming from Zach Wilson's YT camp
* streaming an amazing free course on 'GenAI with Apache Airflow'

I covered [this(https://academy.astronomer.io/introduction-to-genai-with-apache-airflow/1986175] *amazing* free course on Astronomer on using Airflow for a RAG app. It was amazing, and learned a lot about how Airflow works and making a more complex pipeline like:

The 2nd DAG was just to delete the docs from the db:

The UI looks like:

and:

I have thought about an app like that for this blog as well. However, questions like: "what did Ivan study" would have to force a traverse of the whole blog's info, which can just be done with a preset answer ðŸ˜† which I will kind of write for the last day. And questions like "what did Ivan study in day X" - well that might be a slight use case, but also can easily be answered even without an LLM in the RAG - just return the summary I write at the start of each post ~ Nevertheless it was a great blog and taught me some new things about Airflow like dynamic (parallel) task execution, branching, and just creating a more complex DAG.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
