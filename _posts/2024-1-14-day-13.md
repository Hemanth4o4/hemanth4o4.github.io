## Hello :) Today is Day 13!
A quick summary of today:
* started [Machine Learning specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/machine-learning-introduction) by Andrew Ng
* got accepted to present at the [Korea Conference on Software Engineering 2024](http://sigsoft.or.kr/kcse2024/)

First, I wanted to do Andrew Ng's machine learning lecture because I received a lot of recommendations. I am yet to finish it, but below is some of the content

### Gradient descent

We can see how the error decreases with the learning rate and w, b change.

If we keep updating w, b in that manner, we will reach the (global) minimum

### Learning rate

We can use the above method to try different learning rates when training NN models.

### Regularization

Depending on lambda, the strength changes.

**Next, about the KCSE 2024**
During this semester, I wrote a literature review paper related to ChatGPT during my 'Software Quality Guarantee and Test' class, and my professor told me about the opportunity to submit it to the 2024 Korean Software Engineering Conference, so I submitted it and the result came out today, that it got accepted ðŸ¥³ So I will go to present it at the conference.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
