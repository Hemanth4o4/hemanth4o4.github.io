## Hello :) Today is Day 218!
A quick summary of today:
* creating an ML canvas for the KB project
* rewatching LLM zoomcamp module 4 - monitoring

Just like with the fraud insurance claims [project](https://github.com/divakaivan/insurance-fraud-mlops-pipeline), I created an ML canvas:

Finally, I can share the repo as it is public. [Here is the link](https://github.com/divakaivan/kb_project)

The ML canvas took most my time today and also just small checks to make sure that the repo can be easily reproduced using the current code and instructions.
Today I also rewatched 4th module on monitoring for LLMs from the LLM zoomcamp. How come? I saw that the 5th module is finished, and before I cover it I wanted to check everything from the 4th module again. The [5th module](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main/05-orchestration) covers orchestration using my good ol' friend Mage. 



That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
