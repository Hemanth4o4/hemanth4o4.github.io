title: (Day 14) Andrew Ng's Machine learning specialization
categories: [theory]

## Hello :) Today is Day 14!
A quick summary of today:
* Advanced learning algorithms - [Coursera](https://www.coursera.org/learn/advanced-learning-algorithms?specialization=machine-learning-introduction)

Andrew Ng and Professor Yaser S. Abu-Mostafa's teaching methods are similar so I am really enjoying this!

Today I learned about:

* model selection

When selecting a model, keep in mind the words "Do not use test data." You must select a model based on the training and verification datasets to evaluate the model with test data!

* bias vs variance, and regularization

Andrew Ng said that bias and variance theory can be understood, but the difference can only be understood when creating a model. In the future, I should consider bias and variance when making a model

In neural nets, lambda can also be an important hyperparam

* random forest

* decision trees and neural nets

Today was great! Tomorrow I will learn about Unsupervised Learning, Recommenders, Reinforcement Learning

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
