## Hello :) Today is Day 139!
A quick summary of today:
* learned how to host a mlflow server on AWS

I managed to get my card working and finally finished the set up on my AWS account, so I could finish the last bit of module 2 from the [MLOps zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp).

First, go to EC2 console

And set up an instance

We need to select instance type (for me it is the free one)

Then we need to create a key-pair for logging in

And it is done

Next we need to create an S3 bucket

Next, we create a postgresql db

Some configs to choose

And I got a link for the db on port 5432 (which I later use for the mlflow server). We need to give access to EC2 to the database

And we have the console

Where we have to install some dependencies

Install dependencies: pip3 install mlflow boto3 psycopg2-binary

I had to create a user and add some permissions so that it can connect to S3, EC2 and RDS

Then I got it running

So just like when doing it locally we have the db (ofc run on aws), and the mlflow hosted as well

To make sure I do not get any surprising charges on my card, I deleted/stopped all the instances I created.
Looking forward to Module 3 of the MLOps zoomcamp, and also the 2024 version of the Module 2 homework should be uploaded some time in the upcoming week.



On another note, today I found 4 interesting books

I added them to my list to read/study into ^^


That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
