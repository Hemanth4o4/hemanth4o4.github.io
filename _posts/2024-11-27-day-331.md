# Hello :) Today is Day 331!
A quick summary of today:
* watching more of the pre-recorded content on dataexpert.io
* doing more SQL exercises

## Spark + analytical partterns content

Today I covered lectures + labs on the above two topics. As always, I cannot share my notes or anything related as it's content 100% behind the wall on dataexpert.io. 

## More SQL practice

After finishing the SQL practice Qs on the dataexpert platform yesterday, I started looking for other websites with SQL practice questions. I considered the obvious ones - hackerrank and datacamp. But then I asked a person who I know works as a DE and is experienced with SQL about their opinion on a good website (the person is George from the Zach Wilson community server). George suggested [interviewquery](https://www.interviewquery.com/questions) so I signed up for a month (using the blackfriday discount ðŸ˜†) and started from easy to hard Qs again.

Today I solved:

(somehow I set my weekly goal as 25 questions ðŸ˜†)

21 Qs. I was always selecting next Q after finishing one and somehow I solved a medium Q but I checked and there are like 40 more easy Qs (60 in total), and then I will move into Medium (which seem to be the most) and finally Hard.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
