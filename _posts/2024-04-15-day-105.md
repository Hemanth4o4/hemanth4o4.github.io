## Hello :) Today is Day 105!
A quick summary of today:
* Frequent Subgraph Mining with GNNs (covered the next part of Stanford's XCS224W: ML with Graphs)

Covered topics:

Subgraphs, graph isomorphism, subgraph isomorphism, network motifs, subgraph frequency, motif significance, Z-score for statistical significance, significance profile, subgraph matching, isomorphism as an ML task, Order Embedding Space, training neural subgraph matching, frequent motif mining, SPMiner
