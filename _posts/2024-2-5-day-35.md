## Hello :) Today is Day 35!
A quick summary of today:
* [covered Tensorflow Advanced techniques specialization](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/tensorflow-advanced-techniques)

Some of the material is summarised below ^^

### Sequential vs Functional API

When using a functional API, the input layer must be defined directly and each layer must be attached at the end of the next layer. And the input and output of the model must also be defined. Because a model composed of functional APIs can have various inputs and outputs

Functional APIs allow complex models to be configured

Rather than that model, I'll describe it as a simpler model

In addition, the performance and loss functions of each output can be defined separately

### Siamese network model

The Simesen network is a model with two inputs and one output

For example, you can make a model that can compare clothes

The T-shirts were similar, so I classified them as 1.0 (conversely, it would have classified them as 0).

### Custom loss function

If the absolute value of a is less than the threshold we defined, 1/2 * a**2, conversely, threshold * (abs(a) - 1/2 * threshold)
Simple version can be used as follows

Still, there is a better way to organize threshold values (with Class)

### Custom layers

### Custom models

We can make custom/complex models using the functional API

But we can do more complicated models than that

This is an example of ResNet.

I first learned about ResNet on Day 28, but I didn't understand how to do it. But today I found out how functional api can be used.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
