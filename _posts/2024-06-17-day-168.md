Session on building your personal brand with PwC

Your personal brand is how you promote yourself. It is about how you present yourself, what are your values - what do you stand for. 

'Your brand is what others say about you when you're not in the room.' - Jeff Bezos

Personal brand mistakes

* careful with online presence
* communication skills and knowing your environment and how to speak in the workplace
* integrity
* professionalism

Tomorrow is when the Tech-specific sessions start and also the day ends at ~2am for me, so it will be a long day. 

Finally

Right now when I was closing tabs, I saw on youtube a livestream by DataTalksClub. Their [LLM zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/llm-zoomcamp/tree/main) is starting today - and it is the first time they are running it. So I am thinking of joining because at the end (just like their other courses) I will have a nice project that I can add to my portfolio. 

It covers:

1. Introduction to LLMs and RAG
2. Open-source LLMs and self-hosting LLMs
3. Vector databases and retrieval techniques
4. Workshop: dlt
5. LLM orchestration and ingestion pipelines
6. Monitoring and Guardrails
7. Tips and Tricks for advanced RAG systems
8. Project

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
