## Hello :) Today is Day 213!
A quick summary of today:
* using Cypher to create a grafana dashboard for my neo4j database

After setting up neo4j's plugin in grafana a few days ago today I decided to create a live dashboard in grafana. The result:

Each graph requires using Cypher (neo4j's query language). One cool graph I was surprised I could make is the geography map which uses the long and lat of merchants where there was fraud. What else is cool is that the graph updates as new transactions come in. It can update at different intervals, but I tested the 5 second one, and as new data comes in from kafka and sent to the db, the dashboard reflects it. What is more, this time, I saved the dashboard as a json are uploaded it to github.

As seen from the next pic, besides the graph, the other things I did today are a bit trivial - just updating variable names, clean up data preprocessing and make the Mage pipelines better.

The deadline for the project is 11th of Aug, so till then the repo will be kept as private, but after we will make it public and I can share a link.


That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
