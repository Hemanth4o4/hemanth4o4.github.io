# Hello :) Today is Day 345!
A quick summary of today:
* new video by Zach Wilson
* new video by me ?!?!?

## [The Write-Audit-Publish pattern](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ja7VOqDVkuo)

Zach mentioned there won't be a lab for this lecture and given how much Apache Iceberg content I have been **consuming** the last week I decided to give it a go and create some kind of exercise. Especially, since I had read a random blog post about branching in iceberg. Ultimately, I learned a lot about the practical side of WAP. Even if my implementation and example were **super** simple ðŸ˜†

Every time I decide to record a video for something I do not remember how draining it is since I am so slow when it comes to editing ðŸ˜† and I can't edit well either ðŸ˜† so in terms of practicing writing code and also explaining things in a beginner-friendly way ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ðŸ’¯ it is worth it. But after the recording is done, it is soo draining for me ðŸ˜†

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
