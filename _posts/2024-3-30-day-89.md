categories: [theory,statistics]

## Hello :) Today is Day 89!
A quick summary of today:
* covered Classification, Resampling methods, Tree-based models and Some considerations in high dimensions from [An Introduction to Statistical Learning](https://www.statlearning.com/)

Besides the below and yesterday's notes, for not I just read some of the other material of the book. For a while I had the Probabilistic ML: An introduction by Kevin Muprhy on my list (saw it recommended a lot), and it covers

and I am particularly interested in the Foundations part, seeing how the basics are 'born'. But I will start that tomorrow ^^

So ~ here are my notes from the ISLP book for the 4 chapters covered today:
