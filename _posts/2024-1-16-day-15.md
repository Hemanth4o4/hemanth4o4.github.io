As for the Lab - I learned how to adjust the Lambda of neural network models. And with the below code, we can find the optimal value.

Tomorrow, I will finish the last Unsupervisored Learning, Recommenders, Reinforce Learning lectures and quiz and practice labs. 
And, Machine Learning Specialization will be over.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
