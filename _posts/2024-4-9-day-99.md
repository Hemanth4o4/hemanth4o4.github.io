title: (Day 99) XCS224W - ML with Graphs: Theory of GNNs
categories: [theory,gnn]
---

## Hello :) Today is Day 99!
A quick summary of today:
* covered the next part of XCS224W: ML with Graphs

Instead of doing the 3rd homework which is related to createing and training a GNN, I decided to continue with the next theory part, which funny enough is called 'theory of GNNs'. 

Covered topics:
Expressiveness of GNNs, computational graphs, problems with GCN and GraphSAGE's mean and max-pooling, designing the most expressive GNN, the Universal Approximation Theorem, Graph Isomorphism Network (GIN)
