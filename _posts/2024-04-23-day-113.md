title: (Day 113) Making a better blog + Geometric Graph Learning for Biology
categories: [gnn,theory]
---

## Hello :) Today is Day 113!
A quick summary of today:
* began making a blog webpage using [github pages](https://ivanstudyblog.github.io/)
* learning about Geometric Graph Learning from a special lecture in XCS224W: ML with Graphs

New blog link (not finished as of posting): https://ivanstudyblog.github.io/

When I start looking for jobs, I need a better personal website, where I can have more control over the design. Some time ago, I found a template from jekyll that works, but I did not do much work on it, it was kind of standing there in my github profile. Today I played around, and found out how to customize it for my needs. 

This is the home page (with blog posts)

A 'Projects' page where I can list and better show my projects

There is an off-the-shelf search functionality

In the about section, I plan to give a rough overview of what I have studied so far

I am pretty excited. Although, I might need to manually create a markdown (blog post) file for each blog post, and copy-paste content. 

### As for the Geometric Graph Learning for Biology

The lecture was pretty focused on molecular, protein and molecular-protein link generation and issues related with that, which is vastly different from anything I have done (or plan on doing), but it was a good thing to listen to.

Before I wrap up, I tried to do some testing on the db2chat webapp that I developed yesterday, but my groq api key has reached some kind of limit, and I will just let it rest for 24+ hours. 


That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
