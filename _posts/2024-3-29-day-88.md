categories: [theory,statistics]

## Hello :) Today is Day 88!
A quick summary of today:
* Covered Chapter 2: Statitiscal learning, and
* Chapter 3: Linear regression of the infamous [ISLP](https://www.statlearning.com/) book

Today I decided to go over this book that I keep seeing recommended for the basics of machine learning. As a fan of basics, it grabed my interest. 
My notes are below:

**Chapter 2: Statistical learning**
