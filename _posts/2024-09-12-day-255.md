# Hello :) Today is Day 255!
A quick summary of today:
* found and read [this book](https://fleuret.org/francois/lbdl.html) by Francois Fleuret

I randomly saw the author of the book post about it on LinkedIn I think. As a fan of short and to the point books I immediately thought I would like it. It's aim is not to go in depth for any concept but rather provide a quick overview, and even a reminder to the reader about the concepts in deep learning.

What is more, the book is completely free, there is a print version made for A5 paper so I decided to print it, read it and add it to my library.

Below is the table of contents.

It is around 150 pages, and today I finished it. I am glad I found this book, and after reading it I like it as it is very light and simple. Of course, for such a short book it does not go into detail about anything, but is a good overview for someone who knows DL theory, or maybe even for a beginner it can serve as a guidence for what to study.

For the upcoming days, I have a few things to finish:

1. [EvidentlyAI's last 3 modules](https://learn.evidentlyai.com/ml-observability-course/module-5-ml-pipelines-validation-and-testing)
2. [Intro to LangGraph](https://academy.langchain.com/courses/take/intro-to-langgraph/lessons/58239426-lesson-1-state-schema)

And today I looked into more books, and found [Graph Algorithms for Data Science](https://learning.oreilly.com/library/view/graph-algorithms-for/9781617299469/) and [Machine Learning System Design With end-to-end examples](https://www.manning.com/books/machine-learning-system-design)

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
