title: (Day 91) Probability: Multivariate models and Statistics chapters from Probabilistic Machine Learning
categories: [theory,statistics]
---

## Hello :) Today is Day 91!
A quick summary of today:
* Covered Chapter 3: Probability: Multivariate models, and
* Chapter 4: Statistics of [Probabilistic Machine Learning](https://probml.github.io/pml-book/book1.html) by Kevin Murphy

It is April 1st, but the Stanford XCS224W: ML with Graphs starts on 1st of April 9am California time, which is 1am for me (in a few hours). So I guess I can start covering the lectures from tomorrow. (exciting)

As for the Probabilistic ML book, I still have a few chapters to read/cover

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)



p.s. today in my uni statistics class we went over Bernoulli, Binomial, Geometric, Poisson distributions and it was nice talking with the professor and hearing an explanation in person haha (up unitl now every explanation has been through a video or google/chatgpt)
