## Hello :) Today is Day 75!
A quick summary of today:
* covered Section 4: retrieval-based LMs training of [ACL 2023](https://acl2023-retrieval-lm.github.io/)
* covered Section 5: Applications
* Found out about [NVIDIA GTC 2024](https://register.nvidia.com/flow/nvidia/gtcs24/attendeeportaldigital/page/schedule) which is next week and registered for some of the events

Firstly, as for the NVIDIA GTC courses that I registered for over the course of the conference:

There is also a paid workshop on Building Transformer-Based Natural Language Processing Applications but it is sold out, and even though I have joined the waiting list, my hopes are not high haha.

As for my notes on section 4 and 5 of the retrieval-based LM talk
