categories: []
---

## Hello :) Today is Day 221!
A quick summary of today:
* getting the project closer to submission
* welcome to the new blog

### Firstly - the new blog is ready

This is the 1st post in the new blog. I cannot believe that I transferred ~100 posts yesterday. I like this new blog as it is in markdown, all on github, and the UI highly customisable. 

I added some of my projects in the Projects tab at the top as well. There is also a 'hidden' categories page where the below stats can be seen:

This is a summary of the tags I used on my posts. I have not beed completely diligent on properly using them all the time, but it is a nice overview. 

I will not delete the old blog, as it is still valuable, I am just going to create a post that points people to here.

### As for the KB project

I put the current `main` branch with full project info to a new branch called `main-en`, and on the [latest main branch](https://github.com/divakaivan/kb_project) I translated everything to Korean. 

It is the same text, just in Korean so that it is better accepted by the competition assessors.

### Final note - got my MLx certificate

The final Oxford summer school course is 22-24 Aug and it is about [GenAI](https://www.oxfordml.school/genai) (Theory, Agents, Products) and I am really looking forward to that. 

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
