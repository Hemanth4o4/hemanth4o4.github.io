title: (Day 108) Recommender systems + small adjustment to the text2chart webapp
categories: [theory,applying-knowledge,gnn]

## Hello :) Today is Day 108!
A quick summary of today:
* added a field to show generated code by codellama in the [text2chart webapp](http://text2chart.streamlit.app/)
* covered recommender systems from XCS224W: ML with Graphs

### Firstly, about the text2chart webapp

When I create the prompt for codellama, I give it info about the type of columns in the dataframe, using the below logic

It may not be the most robust, but it does fine for now. I thought a problem with the app is that the date column is read as numerical values, and tried to introduce the (now) commented if statement, tested it a bit and it did not seem to do anything.

Then, I decided to show the user what kind of code is being used to generate the shown graph (probably a feature I should have had from the beginning). And this actually made me realise that sometimes the generated code is actually not that good, so a more detailed query might be needed. 

Example:

So if a resulting graph is not good, we can see what was wrong in the code, and give a more specific query. However the downside is, is that if this were a final product, it requires python knowledge from the user, which is not ideal.

### Secondly, recommendation systems

Covered topics:

Modern recommender systems, top-k recommendations, recall@K, embedded-based models for recommender systems, binary loss, Bayesian Personalised Ranking loss, GNNs for RecSys, Neural Graph Collaboration Filtering, LightGCN, PinSAGE (the paper of which I read on Day 100)

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :) 

p.s. feeling a bit better today
