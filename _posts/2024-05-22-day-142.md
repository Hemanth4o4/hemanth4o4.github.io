## Hello :) Today is Day 142!
A quick summary of today:
* did my 4th assignment for the XCS224W:ML with Graphs course
* interviewed for a lab assisstant at my university's Big Data department

Unfortunately, as with the previous assignments, I am not allowed to share anything from them. I can only share about the topic which was heterogeneous graphs (which I learned about on Day 103). It took a bit of review, coding and debugging torch/cuda version disparity, but ~ I got the max score in the end.

As for the interview ~ yesterday I sent an email to the head of the department of the Big Data department at my uni - Professor Minju Park, last night he responded and invited me today at 12 at his office. We had a chat, answered questions, ambitions about research, projects, and at the end ... he said there is 1 space left in his lab and that I can join. The lab is all undergrads and myself (the only non-korean) and I am excited to study, learn, share about anything related to AI - from math to probability to stats to ML to DL. I said I can start from tomorrow, and I will start tomorrow. 


That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
