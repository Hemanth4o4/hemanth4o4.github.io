title: (Day 144) Using Graph Neural Networks to predict taxi passenger demand and origin/destination
categories: [reading-research]

## Hello :) Today is Day 144!
A quick summary of today:
* started reading papers on using graphs for taxi demand and origin/destination predictions

One of the papers my professor wrote is on Measuring taxi ridesharing effects and its spatiotemporal pattern in [Seoul, Korea](https://sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2214367X22001016) and because I am learning about GNNs from Stanford's [XCS224](https://online.stanford.edu/courses/xcs224w-machine-learning-graphs): ML with Graphs I remembered that one of the most popular use cases of graphs is on traffic prediction. 

I read 2 papers:

* [GNN-based Passenger Request Prediction](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2301.02515)
* [Origin-Destination Matrix Prediction via Graph Convolution: a New Perspective of Passenger Demand Modeling](https://zheng-kai.com/paper/kdd_2019_b.pdf)

I actually found the 2nd paper from the 1st paper because it was referenced.

There are these 4 models used as comparison vs the proposed GNN-based model

As for the models, the 1st paper kind of goes off from the 2nd one on the idea to separate a city into grids.

and construct an OD (Origin-Destination/Adjacency) matrix based on that with requests from one cell to another

Below is a pic from the 2nd paper on grids

Compared to the 4 models, the proposed GNN-based one performs the best on MAPE and MAE scores.

There are a few more papers that I have noted to read during the weekend:

Passenger Mobility Prediction via Representation Learning for Dynamic Directed and Weighted Graph

ST-LoRA: Low-rank Adaptation for Spatio-Temporal Forecasting - this one I want to read is because the 2 papers from above that I read - they use this grid cell for origin/destination demand and what if we can use LoRA on that matrix? Might idea might be totally off but I want to explore it.

A greedy approach for increased vehicle utilization in ridesharing networks

Fair and Efficient Ridesharing: A Dynamic Programming-based Relocation Approach



I hope I can think of something to research on these topics! Especially since one of professor Park's interests are in transportation.



That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
