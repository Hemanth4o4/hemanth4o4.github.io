provided GPT2 model code:

```python
datamodule = WikiDataModule(name=model_name, batch_size=batch_size, 
                            num_workers=num_workers)

```
deep-learning-at-scale chapter_4 train_gpt2
```

The book introduces Aim for experiment tracking. It is an alternative to MLflow and I will keep it in mind to check later and try it myself. 

```python
exp_logger = AimLogger(
    experiment=exp_name,
    train_metric_prefix="train/",
    val_metric_prefix="val/",
    test_metric_prefix="test/",
)
```

### Modeling Techniques to Scale Training on a Single Device

#### Graph Compilation

- torch.compile: Converts `torch.nn.Module` to `OptimizedModule`, optimizing graph modules for performance gains (30% to 200%).
- fullgraph: Generates a static graph without eager mode fallback, more efficient when control flow is absent.
- Compilation Modes:
  - default: Balanced approach for large models.
  - reduce-overhead: Minimizes framework overhead, suitable for smaller models.
  - max-autotune: Maximizes tuning for the fastest performance but has the longest compilation time.
- Example Usage:

```python
torch.compile(self.model, mode="max-autotune")
```

- Debugging: Use TORCH_LOGS="graph_breaks,recompiles" for debugging compilation issues.
- Batch Size Optimization: For an A100 SXM 80 GB GPU, a batch size of 24 is optimal for training with single precision (fp32).

#### Reduced- and Mixed-Precision Training

- Memory Consumption: Divided into model parameters, input data, activations, gradients, optimizer states, and metrics/losses.
- Mixed Precision:
  - Combines single- and half-precision formats for efficient computation.
  - Implemented using torch.cuda.amp for CUDA-compatible devices.
  - Memory Penalty: Requires 1.5x memory compared to single precision.
- Usage:

I saw a Microsoft data scientist - VADIM SMOLYAKOV, published a new book on Manning, after looking at the outline I decided to use one of my free credits on there and purchase it.

### Chapter 1: Machine learning algorithms

### Chapter 2: Markov chain Monte Carlo

#### 1. Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) is a methodology of sampling from high-dimensional parameter spaces to approximate the posterior distribution \( p(\theta|x) \).

MCMC methods are used in situations where direct sampling from the posterior distribution \( p(\theta|x) \) is challenging, especially in high-dimensional spaces. MCMC constructs a Markov chain, where each state in the chain represents a sample of the parameters \( \theta \), and the chain is designed so that its stationary distribution is the desired posterior distribution. By running the chain for a sufficient number of steps, the samples generated can be used to approximate \( p(\theta|x) \). These methods are particularly useful in Bayesian statistics, where the posterior distribution is often complex and cannot be directly computed.

#### 2. Monte Carlo (MC) integration has an advantage over numerical integration (which evaluates a function at a fixed grid of points), in that the function is only evaluated in places where there is a nonnegligible probability.

Monte Carlo integration is a method of estimating the value of an integral using random sampling. Unlike traditional numerical integration, which evaluates a function at predetermined grid points, MC integration focuses on sampling points in the domain where the function value contributes most to the integral. This is particularly beneficial in high-dimensional spaces where many regions have negligible contributions to the integral. By concentrating computational effort on areas with significant probability, MC integration can be more efficient and accurate, especially when dealing with complex or high-dimensional integrals.

#### 3. In a binomial tree model of a stock price, we assume that at each time step, the stock could be in either up or down states with unequal payoffs characteristic of a risky asset.

The binomial tree model is a discrete-time model for the price evolution of financial assets, such as stocks. At each time step, the model assumes the stock price can move to one of two possible states: "up" or "down." The movement is determined by probabilities assigned to each state, and the payoffs (or returns) are generally unequal, reflecting the inherent risk of the asset. This model captures the uncertainty in stock price movements and is widely used in option pricing and other financial derivatives, providing a flexible framework to approximate continuous-time models like the Black-Scholes model.

#### 4. Self-avoiding random walks are simply random walks that do not cross themselves. We can use Monte Carlo integration to simulate a self-avoiding random walk.

A self-avoiding random walk (SAW) is a type of random walk where the path taken does not revisit any previously occupied position. This restriction makes the problem more complex and is particularly relevant in modeling physical phenomena like polymer chains. Monte Carlo methods can be used to simulate SAWs by generating many random walk paths and then selecting the ones that do not intersect themselves. This simulation can help estimate properties of the walk, such as its average length or the probability of reaching a certain point without crossing itself.

#### 5. Gibbs sampling is based on the idea of sampling one variable at a time from a multidimensional distribution conditioned on the latest samples from all the other variables.

Gibbs sampling is a specific MCMC method used to sample from a joint distribution when direct sampling is difficult. It works by iteratively sampling each variable in a multidimensional distribution while keeping all other variables fixed at their most recent values. The new value for each variable is drawn from its conditional distribution, given the current values of all other variables. Over many iterations, the samples converge to the joint distribution of interest. Gibbs sampling is especially useful when the full conditional distributions are easier to sample from than the joint distribution.

#### 6. The basic idea of the Metropolis-Hastings (MH) algorithm is to propose a move from the current state \( x \) to a new state \( x' \) based on a proposal distribution \( q(x'|x) \) and then either accept or reject the proposed state according to the MH ratio that ensures detailed balance is satisfied.
 
The Metropolis-Hastings algorithm is a versatile MCMC method for sampling from complex distributions. It starts from a current state \( x \) and proposes a new state \( x' \) using a proposal distribution \( q(x'|x) \). The proposed move is then accepted with a probability that depends on the ratio of the target distribution at the new state to that at the current state, adjusted by the proposal distribution. If the move is accepted, the new state becomes the current state; otherwise, the current state remains unchanged. This acceptance rule ensures that the chain will eventually sample from the desired distribution, satisfying the property of detailed balance.

#### 7. The idea of importance sampling is to draw samples in interesting regions (i.e., where both \( p(x) \) and \( |f(x)| \) are large). Importance sampling works by drawing samples from an easier-to-sample proposal distribution \( q(x) \).

Importance sampling is a technique used to estimate properties of a distribution \( p(x) \) by focusing sampling effort on regions that contribute most to the quantity being estimated. Instead of sampling directly from \( p(x) \), which might be difficult, importance sampling draws samples from a proposal distribution \( q(x) \) that is easier to sample from. The key idea is to weight the samples according to the ratio of the target distribution \( p(x) \) to the proposal distribution \( q(x) \). This weighting corrects for the bias introduced by sampling from \( q(x) \) and allows for more efficient estimation by concentrating on "important" regions of the distribution.
