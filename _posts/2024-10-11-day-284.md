# Hello :) Today is Day 284!
A quick summary of today:
* all-day fune-tuning [movie reviewer LLMs](https://huggingface.co/divakaivan)

It is almost 3am, I had to wait for the final model (mistral) to finish fine-tuning. 

I had to re-calculate the results from yesterday - rougeLSum for the summary and RMSE for the ratings because I was using the wrong ground truth data.

I made a table in excel that I can keep track of my progress and my professor can easily check-in to check my progress

**Prompt v1**

*Your task is to summarise. You are a helpful assistant that helps me evaluate Korean reviews. For each movie you are given 50 reviews. Analyze the reviews, and for the movie itself return a score(1 to 10) and explanation for each of the following criteria: Emotional, Characters, Plot, Visuals, Pacing. Return the review in Korean.*

Train size	185

Evaluation size	15

Evaluation is done using the ground truth dataset and the evaluation dataset

The same hyperparameters were used for all models

*Train time is based on using Kaggle's free T4 GPU

The llama models were trained yesterday but today I fine-tuned and evaluated the Qwen, Gemma and Mistral models.

It was a long day.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
