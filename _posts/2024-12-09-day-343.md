# Hello :) Today is Day 342!
A quick summary of today:
* submitting my 1st report for the company reviewer LLM
* covering some courses on the Dremio university platform
* stream

## First Company Reviewer LLM Report ✔️

[Here is a docs link](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Feu4Zg076_PPLCh-9EiEb0-NEIRYVOa822LF5CyhLe8/edit?usp=sharing). It is 10 pages total, but actually it's not that long as there are many of tables. This is the 1st report I am writing for this project and I followed some base guidelines on including information about data, model selection, parameters, results, and discussion. 

I send it to my lab professor so I am waiting for a response ~ 

This took most of my time last night/today.

## Dremio University and getting a Dremio Verified Lakehouse Associate badge

I saw that Alex Merced (one of the authors of the Apache Iceberg: The Definitive Guide) shared a new page by Dremio called [Dremio University](https://university.dremio.com/courses), which contains some cool short courses taught by Alex himself. I decided to check the courses for the free Dremio Verified Lakehouse Associate badge and they were amazing.

The material covered was partially from the book itself but it was good. 

Here is the text extracted from the image:

- What is Data Lakehouse?  
- What is a Table Format?  
- What is Apache Iceberg?  
- How Iceberg Works  
- Example Transactions  
- Benefits of Apache Iceberg  
- Apache Iceberg Catalogs  
- Ingesting Into Iceberg with Dremio  

I am definitely understanding more how Iceberg works, its benefits, and how to explain it to someone new - which I tried to do today and I think it went well.

## [Streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7pBGkl6VDx4)

I decided to go on stream and do one of the other courses on the Dremio University platform - [Iceberg, Spark and Dremio - A Hands on Experience](https://university.dremio.com/course/am-hands-on-with-apache-iceberg). I wanted to do it on stream as it has both video and practical parts but it turned out I had already covered the practical parts in an older stream, and also the theoretical part was something that I read in the book, and already covered in the associate badge course. Nevertheless, it's good videos by Alex!

That is all for today!
