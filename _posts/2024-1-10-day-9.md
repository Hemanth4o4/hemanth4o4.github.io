## Hello :) Today is Day 9!
A quick summary of today:
* Linear regression to predict student GCPA on [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/code/divakaivan12/linear-regression-to-predict-student-cgpa?scriptVersionId=158434364)

Today I tried to make a simple linear regression model.

**Data**

CGPA, IQ, Placement (whether the student got into college)

**Some viz**

CGPA high => placement=1 degree of certainty is high too. IQ doesn't seem to matter

For fun, I selected IQ and placement as the features, and target is CGPA. 

**Results**

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
