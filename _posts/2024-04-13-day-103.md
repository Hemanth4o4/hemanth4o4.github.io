## Hello :) Today is Day 103!
A quick summary of today:
* continued with XCS224W: ML with Graphs and covered 2/3rds of module 5: Knowledge Graphs

1st part is about ML with Heterogeneous graphs, and 2nd part is about Knowledge Graph embeddings.

**ML with Heterogeneous graphs**

Covered topics: heterogeneous graph,s Relational GCNs, benchmarks for heterogeneous graphs, Heterogeneous Graph Transformers, designing, heterogeneous GNNs
