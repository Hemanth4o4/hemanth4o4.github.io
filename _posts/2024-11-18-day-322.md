# Hello :) Today is Day 322!
A quick summary of today:
* watched lab 2 - SCD modelling
* finished the week 1 homework
* trained a failing prompt tuned llm
* streamed

It is 1am and I am very sleepy so this will be short and sweet ~

## [Data Modeling - Building Slowly Changing Dimensions (SCDs) - Day 2 Lab](https://youtu.be/nyu-8Si21ec)

The lab 2 video was released today so I watched and took some notes.

Here is my code from the lab:

```sql
create table players_scd (
    player_name text,
    scoring_class scoring_class,
    is_active boolean,
    -- for type 2 scd we need the two more cols
    start_season integer,
    end_season integer,
    current_season integer,
    primary key (player_name, start_season)
);

-- we want to calculate how many seasons they have been in a current dim
-- we look at what was the dim before - we use lag
-- the big expensive parts are the windows
-- scale matters and something to always consider
insert into players_scd
with with_previous as (
    select player_name,
          current_season,
          scoring_class,
          is_active,
          lag(scoring_class, 1)
          over (partition by player_name order by current_season)                   as previous_scoring_class,
          lag(is_active, 1) over (partition by player_name order by current_season) as previous_is_active
   from players
   where current_season <= 2022
            ),
    with_indicators as (
        select *,
               case
                   when scoring_class <> previous_scoring_class then 1
                   when is_active <> previous_is_active then 1
                   else 0
                end as change_indicator
        from with_previous
),
    with_streaks as (

order by player_name, streak_identifier


create type scd_type as (
    scoring_class scoring_class,
    is_active boolean,
    start_season integer,
    end_season integer
);

-- see if things have changed
-- this is incremental, the previous is all at once
-- the prev adds all but last year, and this adds the last just for the sake of an example
-- this is processing probably around 20x less data
-- we assume scoring_class and is_active are never null
with last_season_scd as (

And then based on this I completed all the homework:

create table actors (

    actor text,

I hung out in the discord looking at other people's questions and problems ~ 

## I was in the lab today

Today I figured out how to do prompt tuning and I used llama-3.2-1b and ran the training which took ~4 hours, but at the end it seems the model did not learn anything. I am suspecting because of the training arguments I passed. Before I left, I started a 9hr training and left it to go overnight so I will check the results tomorrow. 

## [Streamed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UmZOvOZDfGs)

I watched 2 talks on how Riot Games does data engineering, and uses data to enhance player experience which were very nice (at least the 2nd one, the 1st one was a bit too vague and short). 

Then I had a quick look at sktime - a library for time-series forecasting based on sklearn

---

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
