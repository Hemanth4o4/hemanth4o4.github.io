# Hello :) Today is Day 342!
A quick summary of today:
* apache flink 101 by confluent
* two more homework As
* DQ basics

## [Apache Flink 101 on stream for ~2.5hrs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QPrcCC-lrZQ)

Today I found more free courses on streaming by Confluent [here](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/?course=for-developers#fundamentals)

The course I covered yesterday (ApacheKafka 101) was the 1st course in the series, and today I covered the 2nd - [Apache Flink 101](https://developer.confluent.io/courses/apache-flink/intro/)

The overview:

* what Apache Flink is, and why you might use it
* what stream processing is, and how it differs from batch processing
* Flinkâ€™s runtime architecture
* how to use Flink and Kafka together
* how to use Flink SQL: tables, windows, event time, watermarks, and more
* stateful stream processing
* how watermarks support event time operations
* how Flink uses snapshots (checkpoints) for fault tolerance

The course containes short videos with very well-made explanations and also short exercises where I got to run Flink locally, and play around with FlinkSQL

## Submitted next two homeworks for Zach Wilson's YT bootcamp

* 3rd - Spark queries (joins, aggregations)
* 4th - converting 2 SQL queries to SparkSQL/Dataframe API jobs and writing a chispa test for them

I already had the homework finished but I got a B at first because I forgot the include some parts of my code as I was doing dev in a notebook, but did not add the code to the submission .py file. Anyway got A for both ðŸ¥³

After stream, I wanted to finish a report I am writing for the company reviewer LLM I am fine-tuning for my professor. I think I will share the full one tomorrow :)

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
