title: (Day 4) Looking for a ML book and Microsoft's ML-For-Beginners course
categories: [machine-learning, regression]

## Hello :) Today is Day 4!
A quick summary of today:
* [Financial Risk Management Using Python Machine Learning](https://book.interpark.com/product/BookDisplay.do?_method=detail&sc.shopNo=0000400000&sc.prdNo=356709401)
* Microsoft's ML-For-Beginners lecture 2 - [regression](https://github.com/divakaivan/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/2-Regression)

**Firstly**, when I looked at the table of contents of the textbook, I liked it, but when it arrived today, it was not and I applied for a refund. In the past, I had used [Python deep learning TensorFlow](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000000833270) and [Python deep learning machine learning introductory](https://product.kyobobook.co.kr/detail/S000000833261), so I believe that I can quickly learn through practical tasks. I will keep looking for books. 

**Secondly**, about Microsoft's regression lecture

The content follows

1. Introduced me to scikit-learn and jupyter notebooks, and
2. Making graphs with matplotlib

3. Linear and Polynomial regression
4. Intro to Logistic regression and how it is different from linear
    * Linear Regression: Used when modeling the linear relationship between a dependent variable and one or more independent variables.
    * Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems, where the goal is to classify instances into one of two classes.
  
Tomorrow ~ I will study lecture 3 of ML-For-Beginners and try to find interesting data or notebook in Kaggle and practice on my own.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
