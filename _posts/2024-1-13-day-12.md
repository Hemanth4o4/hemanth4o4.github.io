title: (Day 12) Neural network model for bank churn prediction and making a webapp for exchange rate pred
categories: [applying-knowledge, deep-learning]

## Hello :) Today is Day 12!
A quick summary of today:
* Submitted a neural network model to the [bank churn prediction competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/playground-series-s4e1)
* Following Microsoft's tutorial on [making a simple webapp](https://github.com/divakaivan/ML-For-Beginners/tree/main/3-Web-App)

The SVM model I made yesterday got the below score (not much)

And it got me 1100th place (at that point in time). So I decided to try to make a [NN model](https://www.kaggle.com/code/divakaivan12/nn-churn/notebook) for hopefully better results.

I tried a few, and the results were way better

Also ~~ on [day 7](2024-1-8-day-7.md) I created a model to predict WON/USD exchange rate. From Microsoft's ML-for-beginners tutorial I learned how to publish that simple model using pythoneverywhere. Here is the (simple) [webapp](https://divakaivan.pythonanywhere.com/).

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
