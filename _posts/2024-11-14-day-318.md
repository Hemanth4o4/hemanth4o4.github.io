# Hello :) Today is Day 318!
A quick summary of today:

## Practical notebook attemp

I am writing this at 2am as I was up just continuing what I started on stream - a practical notebook encouraging learners to think of improving models in terms of improving some business metric. I made something that is cool but I think I need to change the idea :D I was going the route of optimising Expected Loss (for loans) but I think I will go down the route of pretending that obtaining official FICO scores is too expensive and a stakeholder wants to use our current data and current scores to try to create a model that replicates the FICO scores for which we pay.

## scikit-learn professional certification - completed

Anyway ~ the big news ~

I did not think I will do it today, but I decided to try and luckily I passed haha

## Comapny reviewer chatbot

Today I was in the lab working on the company reviewer chatbot. Here is an updated table

Tomorrow I will do the few-shot versions.

## [Streamed]

I streamed for a bit today and also had my 1st chat with a viewer - about tutorials/practical exercises/courses I could recommend. Shoutout to 'Benjamin Franklin' (the person's username)

This post is kind of short and the structure is not that great, so apologies for that, but it is 2am and my eyes are almost closed.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
