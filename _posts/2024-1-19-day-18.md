## Hello :) Today is Day 18!
A quick summary of today:
* Started Introduction to TensorFlow for Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning, and Deep Learning by [DeepLearning.AI](https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-tensorflow?specialization=tensorflow-in-practice)

The content follows

There was a simple model using mnist's fashion dataset, and a CNN

In layer.MaxPooling2D(2,2), the image size is reduced, and if Conv2D(3,3) is used, the layer changes each 3x3 pixels to 1 pixel. Therefore, the image shape becomes 11,11,64 from 13,13,64

Also, I got introduced the the `ImageDataLoader`

Today was an introductory part, and I am looking forward to doing the rest (course 2, 3, 4)!

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
