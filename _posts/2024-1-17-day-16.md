## Hello :) Today is Day 16!
A quick summary of today:
* Finished Stanford/DeepLearning.AI's Machine learning specialization

**Firstly**, let me share the final specialization certificate

**As for the learned content**

Today I learned about reinforcement learning for the 1st time, and thanks to Andrew Ng it was absolutely enjoyable

`State` means action

`Return` just like in finance, is an important word

`Policy` tells us which action to take given a state

Depending on the `discount factor` the model's impatience changes

Bellman equation - It is the return if you start from state s, take action a (once), then behave optimally after that

_How should I choose the behaviour correctly while training?_ At first, Andrew Ng said that it would be good to choose a high probability of random behavioural choice and then gradually lower it while training

From tomorrow, I will start preparing for the [TensorFlow developer certificate](https://www.tensorflow.org/certificate) which I found about today

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
