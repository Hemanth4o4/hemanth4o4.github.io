title: (Day 167) Learning about model monitoring
categories: [applying-knowledge,mlops]

## Hello :) Today is Day 167!
A quick summary of today:
* started [Module 5](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/mlops-zoomcamp/tree/main/05-monitoring): Monitoring of the MLOps zoomcamp
* read a bit of Multivariate statistical methods: a primer (which I bought yesterday)

### Firstly, about ML model monitoring

ML monitoring involves looking at things like service health, model performance, data quality and integrity, data and concept drift, performance by segment, model bias/fairness, outliers, explainability.

[Here](https://github.com/divakaivan/MLOps-camp/tree/main/Module%205) are the materials over which I studied today.
Using evidently's python library we can great nice looking reports and dashboards like the below. 

In this, 2 created reports can be seen.

Below is one of the default suggested dataset summary tables

Along with variable info

And this is an example of a simple dashboard we can use to monitor specific items from our reports

### Secondly, some things from the book

* examples of multivariate data
* matrix algebra (vectors, matrices, eigenvalues/vectors)
* visualising multivariate data (draftsman's plot - scatter plot matrix, lines that show profile of variables)
* tests of significance with multivariate data (Hotelling's T-squared test, Box's M-test, Levene's test, Van Valen's test, Wilk's lambda statistic, there were many more that appeared throughout the 20th century)


That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
