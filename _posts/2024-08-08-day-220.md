## Hello :) Today is Day 220!
A quick summary of today:
* read chapter 2 from the book 'Fundamentals of Data Engineering'
* transferred more posts onto the new blog UI

### What Is the Data Engineering Lifecycle?
The data engineering lifecycle by getting data from source systems and storing it. Next, we transform the data and then proceed to our central goal, serving data to analysts, data scientists, ML engineers, and others. In reality, storage occurs throughout the lifecycle as data flows from beginning to end.

There are 5 stages:

* Generation
* Storage
* Ingestion
* Transformation 
* Serving data

Generation: Source Systems

Sources produce data consumed by downstream systems, including humangenerated spreadsheets, IoT sensors, and web and mobile applications. Each source has its unique volume and cadence of data generation. A data engineer should know how the source generates data, including relevant quirks or nuances. Data engineers also need to understand the limits of the source systems they interact with.

Storage

Storage runs across the entire data engineering lifecycle, often occurring in multiple places in a data pipeline, with storage systems crossing over with source systems, ingestion, transformation, and serving. In many ways, the way data is stored impacts how it is used in all of the stages of the data engineering lifecycle. For example, cloud data warehouses can store data, process data in pipelines, and serve it to analysts. Streaming frameworks such as Apache Kafka and Pulsar can function simultaneously as ingestion, storage, and query systems for messages, with object storage being a standard layer for data transmission.

Ingestion

After you understand the data source, the characteristics of the source system you’re using, and how data is stored, you need to gather the data. The next stage of the data engineering lifecycle is data ingestion from source systems.

Source systems and ingestion represent the most significant bot‐ tlenecks of the data engineering lifecycle. The source systems are normally outside your direct control and might randomly become unresponsive or provide data of poor quality. Or, your data ingestion service might mysteriously stop working for many reasons. As a result, data flow stops or delivers insufficient data for storage, processing, and serving.

Transformation

After you’ve ingested and stored data, you need to do something with it. The next stage of the data engineering lifecycle is transformation, meaning data needs to be changed from its original form into something useful for downstream use cases. Without proper transformations, data will sit inert, and not be in a useful form for reports, analysis, or ML. Typically, the transformation stage is where data begins to create value for downstream user consumption. Immediately after ingestion, basic transformations map data into correct types (changing ingested string data into numeric and date types, for example), putting records into standard formats, and removing bad ones. Later stages of transformation may transform the data schema and apply normalization. Downstream, we can apply large-scale aggregation for reporting or featurize data for ML processes.

Serving Data

Now that the data has been ingested, stored, and transformed into coherent and useful structures, it’s time to get value from your data. “Getting value” from data means different things to different users. Data has value when it’s used for practical purposes. Data that is not consumed or queried is simply inert. Data vanity projects are a major risk for companies. Many companies pursued vanity projects in the big data era, gathering massive datasets in data lakes that were never consumed in any useful way. The cloud era is triggering a new wave of vanity projects built on the latest data warehouses, object storage systems, and streaming technologies.

### Major Undercurrents Across the Data Engineering Lifecycle

Data engineers must understand both data and access security, exercising the principle of least privilege. The principle of least privilege means giving a user or system access to only the essential data and resources to perform an intended function. A common antipattern we see with data engineers with little security experience is to give admin access to all users.

Data management is the development, execution, and supervision of plans, policies, programs, and practices that deliver, control, protect, and enhance the value of data and information assets throughout their lifecycle.

DataOps maps the best practices of Agile methodology, DevOps, and statistical pro‐ cess control (SPC) to data. Whereas DevOps aims to improve the release and quality of software products, DataOps does the same thing for data products.

A data architecture reflects the current and future state of data systems that support an organization’s long-term data needs and strategy. Because an organization’s data requirements will likely change rapidly, and new tools and practices seem to arrive on a near-daily basis, data engineers must understand good data architecture

Orchestration is the process of coordinating many jobs to run as quickly and effi‐ ciently as possible on a scheduled cadence. For instance, people often refer to orchestration tools like Apache Airflow as schedulers. This isn’t quite accurate. A pure scheduler, such as cron, is aware only of time; an orchestration engine builds in metadata on job dependencies, generally in the form of a directed acyclic graph (DAG). The DAG can be run once or scheduled to run at a fixed interval of daily, weekly, every hour, every five minutes, etc.



As for the new blog



I am almost done transferring posts. Maybe from tomorrow I will start posting there new ones.



That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
