title: (Day 26) Deep Learning Specialization course by Andrew Ng

## Hello :) Today is Day 26!
A quick summary of today:
* started DeepLearning.AI's specialization course and covered [NNs and DL](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/deep-learning)

The specialization covers 5 courses

I decided to learn a bit more about deep learning.

To summarize the contents, it was about making neural networks which includes forward pass, back pass, and activation function calculation.

* Learned about sigmoid (+wrote the code)

* sigmoid derivative

* how forward and back prop work

This was a bit difficult, but it's very fun. The final programming assignment of the 1st course is to create a neural network model according to the picture above from start to finish! So I will refer to those pics tomorrow when I attempt it.

_Fundamental knowledge is key!_

<br/>

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
