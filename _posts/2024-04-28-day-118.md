## Hello :) Today is Day 118!
A quick summary of today:
- received info on OxML: Fundamentals
- reviewed interestung books on manning.com
- attended a career event in Yonsei university
- invited to do a talk about text 2 chart in an online Stanford event

Firstly, a few months ago I applied and got accepted to attend an online ML summer school organised between AI for global good and Oxford university.

Above is the schedule for the 4-day classes. Plus there are 2 networking sessions. The sessions are live and in Korea the above times are between 9pm and 3am. Even though the sessions are going to be recorded, I will attend them live so that I can ask questions on the spot if needed. 

Secondly, during my bus ride to Seoul I started looking for an interesting book to read on manning.com and I think I found some good candidates worth reading.

 I had a look at a few books, but the above looked the most interesting. Also, among them are 2 project type items which I might not purchase explicitly but subscribe to manning. Below are the table of contents for each one.

Advanced analytics for Business

 This one seems good mainly because it touches practical cases in the business world. However it does not seem likely that the missing chapters will be added soon.

Next, Four Al algorithms with Pothon - this is the projects tope of deal.

 It includes a few projects, but the above one seems the most interesting. One negative is that I am not completely sure how recent these projects are (i.e are thes using outdated or older versions of libraries ).

Next, Build a Custom Chat bot using lang chain and Chat GPT.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgN_lwj7xljDwddOEwwC5Kexbio0x-oc-MskmNjQA5MQV7cfZnHqH_Z6c8UxVNhl0fU3j4hGuOzg77rG65B2SUyeNvOrhkgrZBvf8Nnsej2uqGgOVrmdH3dpX2StHiyKM9Yd9MRL16iJg2D-R9t8XAg2BoaAUPaMm3JjToNiWPNuVujGn8mCCenneiPnKVT)

A potential downside is that it requires an open AI api key which I don't have and do not want to pay for (at the moment at least).

Next, Math and architectures of Deep Learning. 

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEiDMl0OyVryRIc1DpYc7uCU1AmOtGztyeCmIFu1GXDeba853smxjYXy-n8tvPJClG_paleXmKLb1HlzSq_jgpBdV4x9N2NcsCZUZobD0tB67VFtXYhoJVjEqoiibnA6yhaJZrrZHknA8Tj4kSN8CuYpMFehFE4znGCzOY0KusT6CdMaMU5i4WgfoToccL04)

this is one of the top candidates to purchase at the moment. It is complete and it never hurts to re-read and go over important moth concepts.

Next, Algorithms and data structures for massive datasets.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgASN1He3QxMlTImrTufIoBR4n2aNAg2nOjlcuZiLeIcNu1UE3alP0zwcdEAEkOa2KflCNU0meA8fCiO25FcKLm3cCBaWBc_eRICDnpqhS_wSGuL1WYdddZvE__WMk7_qQj7fM-V2upVYz_ivAluuP4sMpTSwqbiXR7CxShQOw0XLFlt9h8-VARTbYH-zUn)

This is another top candidate. Mainly because it is complete and also covers a, what I deem to be, an important topic - dealing with massive datasets.

Next, Grokking Machine Learning.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjoVL6vBQOnzOp3c4kXpV1oHfd0CUvHvdWst3HX0Xqj1BIp3LVDy2thkt4btpkeeBHHZS9mqR6Uy1W7_gwRooAbVAZOjEt7mD7QilAI_Qfp1NG-aJhMhIbsab0uTSQ9JnYX1PcyTzxw6u2VB1u6DYRCWVSXX15iSTX0RUenpZu88B2Wbd6cKN6yfpKVX62L)

 This is one of the books that I have actually seen as recommended and worth reading in various posts and blogs. So, before anything else, reading this one might be the best. 

Finally, Fight fraud with ML.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjmcd9-nCoenE_HB6yOv1Ozl7ojK-PSbBc_BZx9xHFFh-GsNY6lkFKVXKWCDR__Eyvmk2pwVtsAYIafeohBRnQsLWVo_GCnCnh2A2RzL3gSUNvMOx3OVe_qT8fWcda9iIqDZ8lEpSAPu_ScYcbW9lx7RmSF2-icB9Lc4jjkeOTzWFl3kldJvzJWvfsaWKY1)

 This one is extremely promising. However, the missing chapters might not be added one time soon. And those missing chapters are the most interesting.

All, good choices, but I think I will start with Grokking ML.

**Next, about the career event in Yonsei.**

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEhfuwjG_czehmMOfxWlbTXeINz3uolnaQP7NOieMyu90-q5FjxGI-rNS7if1FJTmu5u1FpKuOWiAbXTEsFv1-ayra_C_zW-MpxeNjBYLRzdwb20FqCa3FU6z9OylUYjwMOjSRuX_q-pLGFf2So7P_0J_bGlxeBa_B6dOmgX1A0-psKgnbRttyKb_lt0cfMJ)

 It consisted of 3 panels, but the first one was the most interesting to me as there were panelists from recruitment companies in Korea and thes talked about what is popular now ( Al unsurprisingly). The event was mainly for Vietnamese people as the other 2 panels were about Korea and Vietnam relationship and a Vietnamese influencer.  Never theless, I am glad I a ttended as I found out about 'Wanted Lab' which is a job website where foreigners can find work.

Lastly, for the online Stanford event.
As a student in Stanford's Al professional program, I learned about a show n tell opportunity between students that is held evers month. I decided to submit me text 2 chart app and talk about it. And... I got an email inviting me to present it and demo it at the end-of-June event. 



That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
