title: (Day 77) Review of the ACL 2023 talk, and lecture 10 from CMU's advanced NLP course about retrieval models
categories: [theory,nlp]

## Hello :) Today is Day 77!
A quick summary of today:
* I wanted to review all the content again from the ACL 2023 talk on retrieval-based models (all my notes can be found in the posts from the last 3 days)
* Also decided to cover [lecture 10](https://youtu.be/WQYi-1mvGDM): Retrival and RAG from CMU's 11-711 Advanced NLP course

RAG seems to be an important topic these days, and recently I tried Gemini for the first time too, and on some topics it does give the source, so it is kind of cool and 'hot' in the LLM sphere, and I just read over my notes one more time to clear up any spots.

In regards to lecture 10 on retrieval and RAG by professor Neubig, below are my notes (some content was covered twice, so I am just pointing to the appropriate section of my notes from the ACL talk that covers the particular topic in depth)
