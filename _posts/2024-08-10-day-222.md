## Hello :) Today is Day 222!
A quick summary of today:
* read chapter 3: Designing Good Data Architecture of the Data Eng book


### What is Data Architecture ?

A definition given by the book: _Data architecture is the design of systems to support the evolving data needs of an
enterprise, achieved by flexible and reversible decisions reached through a careful
evaluation of trade-offs._

#### Operational vs Technical data architecture

_Operational architecture encompasses the functional require‐
ments of what needs to happen related to people, processes, and technology. For
example, what business processes does the data serve? How does the organization
manage data quality? What is the latency requirement from when the data is pro‐
duced to when it becomes available to query? Technical architecture outlines how data
is ingested, stored, transformed, and served along the data engineering lifecycle. For
instance, how will you move 10 TB of data every hour from a source database to your
data lake? In short, operational architecture describes what needs to be done, and
technical architecture details how it will happen._

**Good Data Architecture**

Good data architecture serves business requirements with
a common, widely reusable set of building blocks while maintaining flexibility and
making appropriate trade-offs. Bad architecture is authoritarian and tries to cram a
bunch of one-size-fits-all decisions into a big ball of mud.

### Principles of Good Data Architecture

Following the [AWS Well-Architected Framework](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/wellarchitected/latest/framework/welcome.html) consists of six pillars:
* Operational excellence
* Security
* Reliability
* Performance efficiency
* Cost optimization
* Sustainability

Or [Google Cloud’s Five Principles for Cloud-Native Architecture](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/application-development/5-principles-for-cloud-native-architecture-what-it-is-and-how-to-master-it) are as follows:
* Design for automation.
* Be smart with state.
* Favor managed services.
* Practice defense in depth.
* Always be architecting.

The authors expand on these principles by adding:
1. Choose common components wisely.
2. Plan for failure.
3. Architect for scalability.
4. Architecture is leadership.
5. Always be architecting.
6. Build loosely coupled systems.
7. Make reversible decisions.
8. Prioritize security.
9. Embrace FinOps.
