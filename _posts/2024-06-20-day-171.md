## Hello :) Today is Day 171!
A quick summary of today:
* started [Data engineering zoomcamp](https://github.com/DataTalksClub/data-engineering-zoomcamp) by DataTalksClub
* completed IEUK by Bright Network

### Firstly, about the data engineering zoomcamp

I know they deliver good content, and ends up with a solo project that will be a great addition to my portfolio. 

This is the camp overview:

Tons of new things to learn, some old friends (in mage.ai), kafka, dlt, spark, dbt. It was a no brainer decision. So I guess at the moment on different days of the week (I need to set up a schedule) I am taking their data engineering camp, their MLOps camp, and LLM camp. 

As for covered material for today~

Learned about docker, and using postgres on docker. 

Created this dockerfile

And then below are some of the ran comands and steps covered.

Start the postgres server on docker

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c14d9d9b-48ab-4b64-8202-e123a9458a26)

And access it through the terminal

`pgcli -h localhost -p 5432 -u root -d ny_taxi`

Then, using python, I uploaded data and I could query it from the terminal where I ran pgclie

For better user experience, I started a pgadmin server in docker

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/1ed8758f-6740-4de0-b802-dafe70c205e0)

And I could access it on port 8080, however, I could not add a connection to the created table. This is because the two docker instances (postgres and pgadmin) were not connected. To connect them, I used:

`docker network create pg-network`

And then I ran the postgres and pgadmin docker containers in 1 network

And I could make a connection, view and query the data in pgadmin

However, the above two commands required me to run them in 2 separate terminals. To make this a bit more convenient, I used docker-compose.

We first set up a docker-compose.yaml file

![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/29ab7d06-ac4b-4cb7-ab51-e9245706195f)

And *now* I understand what is going on inside this file, and what docker-compose does for us - it combines containers. Awesome!

There are a few videos left from module 1, but everything from today, incuding my command docs are in Module 1 of my [repo](https://github.com/divakaivan/data-eng-camp).

### Secondly, for IEUK by Bright Network

The event ended with the submission of some kind of a work sample where we act as a product manager. 

I can share a bit of mine. It is the product roadmap that I developed. Overall it was a good exercise because those are new things for me ~

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
