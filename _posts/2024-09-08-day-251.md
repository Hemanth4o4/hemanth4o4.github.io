# Hello :) Today is Day 251!
A quick summary of today:
* finished LingoMate - our project for the Seoul Tech Impact hackathon


I have not slept in more than 24 hours now, so this one will be quite short.

[Here](https://github.com/divakaivan/LingoMate) is the repo for our project. In here, is all the info and code of our hackathon project.

I also recorded a 1 min [video](https://youtu.be/CVNY7Xi1Png) as a demo (which was part of our ppt)

And here is some info from our ppt

### What it does
One key to learning a new language is consistent interaction with native speakers and exposure to diverse expressions. LingoMate offers user-friendly, interactive apps that make language learning simple and engaging. Compared to books and video courses, LingoMate is easy to use, simple, and accessible.

### How we built it
- **Ollama 3.1:** One of the LLMs we have used.
- **Grafana:** Used for monitoring and tracking RAG performance/response.
- **ElasticSearch:** Used as the vector database.
- **Postgres:** Used to save user feedback and conversation histories.
- **Streamlit:** Implemented the interface with limited resources.

### Challenges we ran into
- Optimizing prompts to yield appropriate/consistent answers.
- Finding/preparing datasets.
- Enhancing RAG tracing.

### Accomplishments that we're proud of
- I was new to AI, and I am proud that I could absorb/experience LLM in such a short time.
- It was good to put myself in a learner's shoes (who I used to be) and explore how we can help language learners.

### What's next for LingoMate
- Expand into multiple languages. Offer more combinations of input/output languages to scale it up.
- Scale up datasets, cover broader topics, and enhance model performance.
- Offer features to track histories of conversations for a user.
- Enhance UI.
- With data-driven recommendations, we are aiming to let users personalize their learning.

Finally, below is a pic from the stream when we were presenting:
