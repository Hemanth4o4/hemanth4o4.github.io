# Hello :) Today is Day 269!
A quick summary of today:
* [did my 1st stream](https://youtu.be/dvqmZHNLtp4)
* attempted the capstone project (part 1) from the DE specialisation

## Firstly, about my first stream

There is content that I want to watch/rewatch and not take notes. But just pasting a link here (in the blog) to the thing I watched seems too little. If I do it on stream, it can count as a bit more content (and as proof that I watched/covered that content). But also if any other learners join my stream we can have a chat about whatever I am doing. Today I spent some time setting up my stream and camera

And I want to stream on youtube. I could stream on twitch, but I do not associate twitch with studying, whereas on youtube I have seen many people do study with me livestreams. Unfortunately, I had to request access and it takes 24hrs to get it. Today I requested it and tomorrow I will get it, and today I streamed on twitch and uploaded the vod to youtube. For now, I am planning to do 1-2 hour streams Monday to Thursday from 6pm KST. 

Today I finished [The Complete Mathematics of Neural Networks and Deep Learning](https://youtu.be/Ixl3nykKG9M). I watched most of it earlier in the day, and on stream I watched the last 1 hour.

Here are some resources shared which seem interesting: 

* [The Matrix Calculus You Need For Deep Learning](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1802.01528)
* [How the backpropagation algorithm works](http://neuralnetworksanddeeplearning.com/chap2.html)

## DE specialisation Capstone project part 1

I am at course 4 on Joe Reis' DE specialisation on Coursera. The only things left for me to complete the course are the last 2 capstone projects. I have been waiting for an error to be fixed by the Coursera engineers and today I saw that it got fixed. The error was related to access when running terraform apply so that I can run glue jobs for extracting and transforming data. That part was fixed and my grade is now:

For the parts I have 0, I wrote a [post](https://community.deeplearning.ai/t/capstone-project-part-1-grading-optional-chapter/697934/11) as I genuinly don't understand where the error could come from as I have followed the instructions carefully. Other people are stuck at the same place as me, and it seems the problem might come from the auto-grader (but we will see what the engineers say).

## New books from the library

Today I decided to check the uni library for some books, and it turns out that two gems were available to borrow

I can't wait to read them. I really prefer having physical books than reading them online.

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
