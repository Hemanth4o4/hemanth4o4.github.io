# Hello :) Today is Day 235!
A quick summary of today:
* recording the final real-time pipeline video
* meeting with our lab professor for final feedback on our ppt


Yesterday when I was recording the final video that shows the real-time pipeline in Mage

I hit the kakaotalk messaging api rate limit so today I had to do the final version. As a complete novice when it comes to recording and editing - it is a bit hard. I spent around 3 hours recording and editing - and the final video is 40 seconds ðŸ˜† haha. [I uploaded it to youtube.](https://youtu.be/tdUVbWcj7oM)

This was my morning till lunch. After that I went to the uni lab to meet with my project partner and our professor to talk about our ppt. When we have the final final version of our ppt I will share it here as well. The submission deadline is this Sunday afternoon as Monday evening is a rehersal and Tuesday is the event itself with all 10 finalists - I will share info about these events in due course as well. 

In our ppt we basically go over background info, why our idea for a real-time pipeline for fraud detection, and then we dive into the two main pipelines - model training pipeline and real-time pipeline like shown in the picture below:

We met with our professor on Monday (or Tuesday) this week for initial feedback, and compared to know the professor said it is way better and is happy with our progress, and we can add just small things before we submit it on Sunday. 

That is all for today!

See you tomorrow :)
