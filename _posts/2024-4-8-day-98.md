title: (Day 98) Finishing XCS224W - ML with Graphs' 2nd homework on GNNs Using PyTorch Geometric
categories: [applying-knowledge,theory,gnn,nlp]

## Hello :) Today is Day 98!
A quick summary of today:
* completed the whole 2nd homework of XCS224W: ML with Graphs
* started reading Vicki Boykis' 'What are embeddings?' [book](https://vickiboykis.com/what_are_embeddings/)

**About the homework**

The topic was: GNNs Using PyTorch Geometric, but I am afraid that is as far as I can go. We are not allowed to share info about the homeworks, but it was based on my notes from Days 94, 95 and 96. 

My score:

I had a quick look at assignment 3 and apparently its based on Days 94, 95 and 96 as well, so for tomorrow I will either take a break and not do 2 assignments in a row by continuing to watch the next lectures, or do it as well. (the 1st option is more likely)

As for the book 'What are embeddings?' by Vicki Boykis 

I had it on my list for a bit and I just wanted to read it and make take some notes (which are below). But most (if not all) the info was already covered when I covered [CS224N](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rmVRLeJRkl4&list=PLoROMvodv4rMFqRtEuo6SGjY4XbRIVRd4) NLP with DL: from Day 57 ~ Day 65. Still it was nice to confirm my knowledge. I did not cover all (the notes below are up until the half-way point I believe)

This is all for today!
