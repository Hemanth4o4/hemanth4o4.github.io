Hello!

On the 2nd of January 2024, I embarked on a, what I thought would be, 50 day journey to learn about Machine Learning. It is way past the 50 day mark, and I keep learning and blogging. 

On Day 100 I knew it was not over, so I continued.

After a few days I decided to go for the full year.

My studies have become a cover of math, stats, data engineering, classical machine learning, modern deep learning architectures, AI assistants, MLOps systems. So far this journey has been about the technical side of things, but crucially also about thinking as DataEng/DataScientist/MachineLearningEng/DataAnalyst and developing the soft skills needed for any of these roles. Also about learning how I learn, but others too which I will summarise by the end of this 1-year journey. 

**These days I stream part of my daily studied on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ilearnthings123) - Monday to Thursday 10AM GMT+1/6PM KST**
