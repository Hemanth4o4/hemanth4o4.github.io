Hello!

On the 2nd of January 2024, I embarked on a, what I thought would be, 50 day journey to learn about Machine Learning. It is way past the 50 day mark, and I keep learning and blogging. 

On Day 100 I knew it was not over, so I continued.

After a few days I decided to go for the full year.

My studies have covered a range of topics, including mathematics, statistics, data engineering, classical machine learning, modern deep learning architectures, AI assistants, and MLOps systems. This journey has not only been about mastering the technical aspects but also about adopting the mindset of a Data Engineer, Data Scientist, Machine Learning Engineer, and Data Analyst, while developing the soft skills essential for these roles. Additionally, it has been a process of learning how I learn—and understanding how others learn—which I plan to summarize at the end of this 1-year journey.

**These days I stream part of my daily studied on [my youtube channel](https://www.youtube.com/@ilearnthings123) - Monday to Thursday**
