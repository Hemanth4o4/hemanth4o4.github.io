Hello!

On the 2nd of January 2024, I embarked on a, what I thought would be, 50 day journey to learn about Machine Learning. It is way past the 50 day mark, and I keep learning and blogging. 

Topics covered so far:
* Calculus
* Probability and statistics
* Classical ML methods
* Deep learning
* Computer vision
* Natural Language Processing
* Graph Neural Networks

The list is not in order, I keep going between high and low-level concepts, so that I do not fall victim to the [law of leaky abstractions](https://www.joelonsoftware.com/2002/11/11/the-law-of-leaky-abstractions/). 

Courses covered:
