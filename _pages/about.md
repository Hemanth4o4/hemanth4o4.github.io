Hello!

On the 2nd of January 2024, I embarked on a, what I thought would be, 50 day journey to learn about Machine Learning. It is way past the 50 day mark, and I keep learning and blogging. On Day 100 I knew it was not over, so I continued. After a few days I decided to go for the full year.

For a full summary, check my [Day 366 post](https://ivanstudyblog.github.io/day-366).

I spent my time learning about these topics:

I spent my time learning theory and practice:
